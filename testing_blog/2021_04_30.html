	<h1> 30 Apr 2021 </h1>
	<h2> Received a couple of acceptance letters! </h2>
	<p> Got the A*STAR scholarship! Don't really think I'll actually sign up to this scholarship, but definitely feels good knowing I have someone to fund me if I really want to study at Imperial College London. </p>

	<p> Got into SMU law school as well! Another suuurrrpriseeee~ But I'll probably dump this offer somewhere amongst my last choices. Don't think I'm a law kind of person <i> ops.</i></p>

	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	<p> I might have deceived those A*STAR people into thinking that I'm a bubbly person. <em> What I am is a good faker </em> . There is a real possibility that I may crack under the pressure of a PhD... </p>

	<h2> Dinner </h2>
	<p> Dad threw in some squid (?) as well. Not bad ~</p>
