	<p> I got a new book today! After eyeing this book for months, I finally got it from Kinokuniya. The book costed me 45 dollars &mdash; pretty expensive &mdash; but definitely worth the money. The drawings are magical and breathtaking. <i> How I wish I could live in those beautiful tales. </i></p>

	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	<p>Today was a standard working day: blue-shift from 8am to 3pm. Got home just in time for a Zoom interview regarding a new job. <i> It sounded really like a scam </i> <img src="https://hotemoji.com/images/dl/q/eye-roll-emoji-by-google.png" style="width:1em;">
	</p>

	<p>Slept for half an hour and then got up for exercise. I think I have lot some muscle mass lately ... Shouldn't have starved myself for those bite-sized Greek foods ... Anyways, dinner was a huge bowl of Salmon noodle. </p>

	<p> My feelings have been rather raw these days. Focus on the little beautiful things in life. <em> Life is short, be happy </em> </p>
