	<p class="new_para"> We went all the way to a Subway at Yishun because it was equally far from both of our houses. <img src="icon/tears.png" class="icon"> The day before, I did argue <em> quite a bit </em> with Ana over whether I should be getting the sugar-loaded double chocolate cookie. </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Option 1: skip cookie + exercise + normal dinner </li>
		<li> Option 2: eat cookie + exercise + normal dinner</li>
		<li> Option 3: eat cookie + no-exercise + normal dinner </li>
		<li> Option 4: eat cookie + no-exercise + skip dinner </li>
		<li> Option 5: eat cookie + no-exericse + Simply Wrapps' salad for dinner </li>
	</ul>

		<p> <mark>Option 1</mark> was eliminated because I <b> do </b> want to eat a Subway double chocolate cookie. Haven't eaten it in sooooo looooong. <mark>Option 2</mark> was out because I didn't want to keep thinking about <i> burning excess calories </i> while exercising. Ana never lets me off easily after red-light foods. Exercise is an enjoyment, not to be reduced to a calorie-balance. <mark>Option 3</mark> was a no-no since the very beginning. I knew Ana would drive me crazy. <mark>Option 4</mark> was discarded after some serious contemplation: Even though Ana would approve of this, I am afraid of losing my muscles if I skip dinner. Also, the state of starving is not a particularly pleasant one. <mark>Option 5</mark> was the best one: I get to avoid Ana and keep my muscles (and stomach) happy. </p>

	<p class="new_para"> The cookie was <s> disappointing</s> okay  ... It would be better with less salt. Definitely wasn't as good as I rememebered it. </p>

	<p> Dinner was decent. The cherry tomatoes were bursting with flavours. I love salads. They look so pretty. Most importantly, They make me feel safe.</p>

	<h2> Library</h2>
	<p> Discovered a book: Milk Fed, written by Melissa Broader. The protagonist has lived an even more extreme version of my life. Counting calories, prescribing regimes, setting boundaries, seeking approval. <i> She even thinks like me. </i> </p>
	<p class="new_para quot"> &quot; I didn't like eating with others. Lunch was the crown jewel of the day, and I preferred to savor it solo, not waste it on foods I hasn't chosen. &quot; &mdash; <i>"Milk Fed"</i></p>

	<p> <b> Do not become a second Rachel. </b> Life is about the journey, why make it into a quest? There are so many people out there, so much wonderful life experiences waiting to for you. Don't let fear of the unknown make your life anything less.<img src="icon/rainbow.png" class="icon"></p>
