		<h2> Dinner</h2>
		<p> Dad started adding broccoli! I love the taste, but broccoli seems to trigger bloating? And, broccoli is quite calory-packed when it comes to veggies. I probably shouldn't been counting calories of veggies, but it's becoming my second-nature nowadays... </p>

		<h2> Conclusion</h2>
		<p> I am starting to worry about the amount of memorization that dentistry requires. I didn't take biology in high school so I am not sure if I could easily find a workable study method/schedule? I am praying that I am luckly enough to graduate on time</p>
