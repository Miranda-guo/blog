<section class="dinner">
	<h2> Dinner with Onion</h2>
	<p> Anna told me to skip lunch with Onion, and I did. I am sorry but ... I am just too weak.... </p>
	<p> Anyways, dinner was awesome! The restaurant was "platform 1904" and the foods were beautifully prepared. We talked about random things, and the conversation wasn't labored. <i> Thanks god</i></p>

<section class="sleepover">
	<h2> Sleepover</h2>
	<p> We talked until 3am. I told her about my Anorexia, and other stories of my life. This is probably gonna be the last few times I would ever see her. I wanted her to know who I truly am. She is a good listener, non-judgemental. <i> Unlike the psychiatrist the other day... </i></p>
