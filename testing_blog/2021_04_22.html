	<h2> Dinner</h2>
	<p> I went out with Mona for dinner today. He deemed the food at 悦龙门 as &quot; okay &quot;. Our conversation was kind of boring. I told him about:
		<ul>
			<li> Nabilah and her boyfriend</li>
			<li> My NLB interview</li>
			<li> ASTAR reference letter (He rated me 8 out of 10 for intelligence HAHA)</li>
		</ul>
	 </p>

	 	Mona magicked out some tomatoes from his own tomato plant. The fruits were sour, and definitely my type of food.

	 <h2> Shopping </h2>
	 <p>
	 	We strolled around after dinner. I bought a 3D cat picture for Nicie's birthday!

	 <h2> Culture trip (?) </h2>
	 <p>
	 	Mona brought me to a old Hawker center in Chinatown. Most of the stalls were shuttered already. We walked around aimlessly before I suggested that we go home.

	 <h1> End day conclusion </h1>
	 <p>
	 	For some reason, I wasn't exactly being myself today. At the start, I was trying to be more upbeat. But I soon exhausted myself, so I guess I reverted back to my old self. By then, I no longer felt compelled to reply to everything he said. <i>It was so much easier this way</i>.
