	<h1> 21 Apr 2021</h1>
	<p> I went to NLB for a scholarship interview today. The interviewers seemed pretty nice and chill. They asked a couple of standard interview questions 
		<ul style="font-size: 2em">
			<li> What is unique about you </li> 
			<li> Why should we choose you</li> 
			<li> How would current trends affect the future operation of NLB (eg digitalisation)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	 <p> Since I totally didn't prepare anything, I just spoke whatever came to my mind. Afterall, I just wanted to experience (and hopefully, master) interviews. <br>
	 
	 <br>

	 The last question was about the future of NLB. I think I nailed it. I told them that I believe the future of library is unlimited. I guess that is what they want to hear?? Not sure though. <br>
	 <i><b> Anyways</b> </i>, I don't really care about this scholarship.
