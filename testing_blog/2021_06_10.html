	<h1> 10 June 2021</h1>
	<p> Anna is taking over me. Dad brought home some Chinese cold dishes today. I freaked out. I literally racked my brain to get away without eating it. First, I exercised for as long as I could, waiting for him to go out for his daily stroll, so I could dump every single morsel after he leaves. But he stayed on the sofa all the way until 7pm. I was starving. In the end, I lied to him, saying that I needed to attend a Zoom meeting so I would have to eat the foods infront of my computer screen &mdash; alone. What I actually did was dumping the foods into a plastic bag and stashing them underneath my bed. I waited for him to leave the house before throwing them straight into the dump chute. I knew better than to throw them into the rubbish bin. He would figure out what happened the moment he looks into the bin. That's why everything has to go straight to the dump chute.  <i> I never knew I could be so ingenious.</i> </p>
	<p> I ended up with a wrap, two medium tomatoes, 250ml of soymilk, a Meiji yoghurt and 18 nuts for dinner </p>
	<p> Anna is becoming so overwhelming... I think I'm losing my mind to her. She lurks around my mind so often that I can no longer tell my voice apart from hers...</p>

	<p>My body is telling me that I am still hungry.</p>

	<p> But this hunger is making me feel so very <b> safe</b>. <i> I need help, don't I? </i></p>
