	<li> At our last session, she'd encouraged me to "parent myself". This idea seemed positive, doable, maybe even fun. I was going to speak gently to young Rachel, tell her that everything was going to be okay in hushed, empathetic tones. I'd be a mother to me &dash; Page 16 <br>

		"Well, I think she's rather lovely," said Dr. Mahjoub. "Don't you think she's lovely?" <br>
		"She's fine," I said. <br>
		"Yes, I think she's quite lovely. And I think she's worthy of love &mdash; more than worthy of love, actually? Don't you think so?" &dash; Page 37

		Was I losing her? Did she no longer like me? I could never tell how other people saw me. Most of the time I felt like I was riding around in a car with a fogged windshield that made it difficult to decipher the perceptions of others. No matter how fast I ran the wipers, I couldn't clear the fog &dash; Page 103

		I'd spent so much time cutting and carving away at myself, worshipping cold. I feared that light and warmth were a trick, a tease, false offerings that lured you into relaxing, and just when you made yourself vulnerable, they would be seized. Better to adapt to the cold. Better to thrust the cold on oneself. Be prepared &dash; Page 150

		Cholent, a stew of warm beef, carrots, beans, and potatoes, was meant to be savoured. Life could be savored. I was surprised to think for a moment that if there was a god, this could be god's wish for us &dash; Page 151

		"Care for a nut?" he asked. <br>
		"No, thank you," I said. <br>
		"Would it kill you to have a cashew?" he asked, smiling.<br>
		"It might," I said, smiling back. <br>
		"Little Rachel," he said. "Tell me, How are your roots feeling? Have you been going deep?"<br>
		"To be honest, Rabbi, I feel scared," I said.<br>
		"What's to be scared of?" he asked.<br>
		"Spreading," I said. "Not much vertically but horizontally." <br>
		"What's so scary about the horizontal?"<br>
		"I don't want to spread out into some crazy far outer reaches," I said. "What if I can't get back?"<br>
		"Eh," he said. "What's to get back to?"<br>
		It was a good questions. I didn't know what to say. <br>
		"Just because it feels good doesn't mean it's wrong," said the Rabbi.
